# Multi-Tenant React App

This is a sample React application that demonstrates how to implement multi-tenancy in a web application using React.

## Getting Started

To get started, first clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/example/multi-tenant-react-app.git

Next, navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd multi-tenant-react-app
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server:
```
npm start
```

You should now be able to view the app in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Overview

This application demonstrates how to implement multi-tenancy in a React app using a single rule that determines which components should be rendered for each tenant. The `App` component contains a `TenantSelector` component that allows the user to select a tenant. When a tenant is selected, the `App` component renders the appropriate components based on the selected tenant.

## Components

### App

The `App` component is the main component of the application. It contains a `TenantSelector` component and renders the appropriate components based on the selected tenant.

### TenantSelector

The `TenantSelector` component is a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a tenant. It is rendered by the `App` component.

### TextRule

The `TextRule` component is a simple component that displays the text "Text Rule" on the screen. It is rendered by the `App` component for certain tenants.

## Testing

This application includes unit tests for the `TenantSelector` and `App` components. To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```
